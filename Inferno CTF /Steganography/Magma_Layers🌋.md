- Download the image magma_layers.png: 
use **binwalk** to check embedded files in the image

```bash
$ binwalk magma_layers.png
7279          0x1C6F          Zip archive data, encrypted at least v1.0 to extract, compressed size: 40, uncompressed size: 28, name: secret.txt

- we can see there is a zip file hidden we have to extract it:
```bash
$ binwalk -e magma_layers.png
```

- then you cd to the extracted directory:
```bash
$ cd _magma_layers.png.extracted
```

- and unzip : `unzip secret.zip` (oupssss there is a password hahaha)

we can use `strings secret.zip` and we can see this weird string "**LAYERS123**"

and the try to unzip one more and use that string as the **password** and you'll get your flag
